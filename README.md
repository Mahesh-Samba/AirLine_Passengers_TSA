# AirLine_Passengers_TSA
Airline passengers' data set analysis using Time series analysis.
I used the airline_passengers dataset to perform a time series analysis in this project. 
I performed EDA with line plots and seasonal decomposition to understand the data better. 
The dataset was split into training and testing sets, and I used a grid search approach to tune the hyperparameters of the SARIMA model. The best SARIMA model was trained and evaluated, and I visualized the actual versus predicted passenger counts over time. The independent variable is time, and the dependent variable is the number of passengers.
